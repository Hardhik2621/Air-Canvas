Writing in air has been one of the most fascinating and challenging research
areas in the field of image processing and pattern recognition in recent years. It
contributes immensely to the advancement of an automation process and can
improve the interface between man and machine in numerous applications. Several
research works have been focusing on new techniques and methods that would
reduce the processing time while providing higher recognition accuracy.
The project takes advantage of this gap and focuses on developing a
motion-to-text converter that can potentially serve as software for intelligent
wearable devices for writing from the air. This project is a reporter of occasional
gestures. It will use computer vision to trace the path of the finger. The generated
text can also be used for various purposes, such as sending messages, emails, etc.
It will be a powerful means of communication for the deaf. It is an effective
communication method that reduces mobile and laptop usage by eliminating the
need to write.
This project can also be embedded into online teaching platforms making the
process much easier, interesting and effective. This is a drawing/writing tool which
can draw anything on it by just capturing the motion of a colored marker with a
camera. Here a colored object at the tip of the finger is used as the marker. Here
Color Detection and tracking are used in order to achieve the objective. The color
marker is detected and a mask is produced. It includes the further steps of
morphological operations on the mask produced which are Erosion and Dilation.
Erosion reduces the impurities present in the mask and dilation further restores
the eroded main mask.
